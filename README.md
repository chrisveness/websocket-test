WebSocket Test
==============

Test of using WebSockets to perform server-initiated page refresh or display a server-pushed message.

This test pushes a message after a random interval and displays the message in a div; every 4th message is a page refresh.

`npm start` and open localhost:3000/page to see it in action.
